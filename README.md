# Overview üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

This is my fourth project for Start2Impact University. The project involves the development of a TypeScript system that models the operational structure of a startup that promotes citizens access to state bonuses, focusing on the interactions between startups, state incentives and participating citizens.

First I created the three interfaces with the related properties and methods, then I created the classes that implement the interfaces and finally I instantiated the objects and tested the operation via console.log
